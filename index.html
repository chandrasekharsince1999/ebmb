   The use of internet in day to day life is increasing exponentially in
today's world. Pharmaceutical industries are marketing their drugs and
other medicines extensively on social networking sites and other
platforms. With the easy availability of information, there also exists
the vulnerability to misinformation in online pharmaceutical
marketing. Five converging factors has been identified by the
researchers, they are: 1. Internet dependence, 2. excessive trust in the
veracity of online information, 3. unawareness of pharmaceutical
company influence, 4. social isolation and 5. detail fixation. As the
Internet continues to change, it is important that regulators keep in
mind not only misinformation that surrounds new web technologies
and their contents. The market of pharmaceutical industries is big
online thus, there is a huge probability of the threat to misinformation
in online marketing. As this industry is crucial and has a direct impact
on public health, it is important to restrict such industries from doing
such practices. In this paper, we have reviewed verifi2 software,
which is helpful in detecting misinformation on different online
platforms. </p>

     The Pharmaceutical industry is one of the most fastest growing
   industries in India as well as in world right now. Basically, the
   Pharmaceutical Industry discovers, develops, produces, and markets
   the drugs or pharmaceutical drugs for use as medications to be
   administered (or self-administered) to patients, with the aim to cure
   them or to vaccinate them, or alleviate the symptoms. Pharmaceutical
   companies deal in generic or brand medications and medical devices.
   They are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that control the
   patenting, testing, safety, efficacy and marketing. </p>

   <p class="paragraph4" style = "margin-top: 15px; border:1px solid black;">
     The History of this industry can be traced back to the mid
     1800ꜱ. 1850ꜱ ᴛᴏ 1945: ꜰʀᴏᴍ ʙᴏᴛᴀɴɪᴄᴀʟꜱ ᴛᴏ ᴛʜᴇ ꜰɪʀꜱᴛ ꜱʏɴᴛʜᴇᴛɪᴄ ᴅʀᴜɢꜱ
The pharmaceutical industry began with local apothecaries that
expanded from their traditional role distributing botanical drugs such
as morphine and quinine to wholesale manufacture in the1850s, and
from discoveries resulting from research and development.

6
drug discovery from plants began with the isolation between 1803 and
1805 of morphine - an analgesic and sleep-inducing agent - from
opium by the German apothecary assistant Friedrich Sertürner, who
named this compound after the Greek god of dreams, Morpheus. By
the late 1880s, German dye manufacturers had perfected the
purification of individual organic compounds from tar and other
mineral sources and had also established rudimentary methods in
organic chemical synthesis.

<p class="paragraph5" style = "margin-top: 15px; border:1px solid black;">
  The development of synthetic chemical methods allowed scientists to
systematically vary the structure of chemical substances, and growth in
the emerging science of pharmacology expanded their ability to
evaluate the biological effects of these structural changes. An estimated
2.4 billion people, or approximately 34% of the global population, have
Internet access. Internet usage is particularly widespread in
industrialized regions. Europe, for example, boasts approximately 518
million Internet users.
An estimated 2.4 billion people, or approximately 34% of the global
population, have Internet access. Internet usage is particularly
widespread in industrialized regions. Europe, for example, boasts
approximately 518 million Internet users.With growing Internet use, the volume of online health information
available – as well as such information sought – has increased. From
2005 to 2007, Europe experienced a 10% rise in health-related
searches. As the Internet has grown, pharmaceutical companies have
increasingly used it to influence patients to request – and physicians to
prescribe – medical drugs.
Although the Internet is a particularly powerful medium to inform and
market, it can also be used to misinform and mis market. Whenever
pharmaceutical companies mislead users or withhold from them
relevant safety or efficacy information, this influence may be counted
as ‘misinformation’.
Inaccuracies, imbalances, failures to meet accepted scientific standards
and other misleading presentations may all result in poor patient
outcomes, including increased healthcare costs (when patients are
persuaded to buy new drugs over cheaper alternatives, including nonpharmaceutical treatments) and injury or death (when patients are
persuaded to buy drugs for which there exist safer alternatives, or for
which marketed drugs are not fully approved).
Pharmaceutical company misinformation occurs not only because of
the supply of misleading information strategies by companies, but also
because of the psychological vulnerabilities of people who rely on this
information. Vulnerable Internet users – whether patients in need, or
clinicians strapped for time – are more likely to be misled. There is
need, therefore, for a more nuanced understanding of the interaction
between Internet-enabled misinformation and human vulnerabilities to
this misinformation.Despite extensive evidence of pharmaceutical company
misinformation strategies, almost no previous work to our knowledge
has identified what major factors make Internet users vulnerable to such
misinformation in the first place. Here, we employ a systematic review
to address this question.
We identified five majors, closely-related factors that contribute to
Internet users’ vulnerability to misinformation from pharmaceutical
company marketing. An awareness of these vulnerabilities can inform
public and professional education designed to promote wiser use of the
Internet as a health information resource. <br>

    .As we discussed about online marketing of pharmaceutical industries
in detail, we got an overview on this particular topic. A lot of research
has been done in this field. These studies include the Psychological
factors, Management case studies and many more.
In this section, we are going to give a literature review on the
available literature related to this topic. </p>

  Digital' (in any way) has become an important part of the everyday life.
  All the sectors have been adapting to the digital and artificial
  intelligence era at a faster rate day by day. However other than the
  websites and advertisements, the pharmaceutical industry has not quite
  been able to adopt the digital marketing. In this era more
  pharmaceutical companies are utilizing social media sites or ecommerce sites as digital marketing platforms. This enables online
  purchase of products by the customers easily and without any
  difficulty. Some organisations are trying to understand the true value
  of digital while others are integrating it into the wider marketing
  strategy. However, all the companies cannot sell products online as
  they manufacture prescription drugs and medicines, which cannot be
  sold online without any recommendation.

<br>In the domain of decision-making psychology, this article details with
how drug marketing operates across established and novel web
domains and identifies some common misleading methods and trends
and influences on prescribing and suggesting medication requests. The
Internet has allowed pharmaceutical marketing to become more salient
than ever before. Although the Internet's growth has improved the
dissemination of pharmaceutical information, it has also led to the
increased influence of misleading pharmaceutical marketing. Such mis
marketing is of concern, especially in psychiatry, since psychotropics
generate considerable amount of revenue for drug companies. In a
climate of resource-limited drug regulation and time-strapped
physicians, we recommend improving both independent monitoring
and consumer awareness with the use of internet facility, potentially
misleading, pharmaceutical marketing influences.</p>

  In this research, they have introduced an app called Verifi2, a visual
analytic system to support the investigation of misinformation on social
media platforms. On one hand, social media platforms empower
individuals and organizations by giving a power of sharing the
information. On the other hand, even well-informed and experienced
social media users are vulnerable to misinformation in some or the
other way. To address the issue, various models and studies have emerged from
multiple disciplines to detect and understand the effects of
misinformation in different context. However, there is still a lack of
intuitive and accessible tools that help social media users distinguish
misinformation from verified news. In this paper, they have presented
Verifi2, a visual analytic system that uses state-of-the-art
computational methods to highlight salient features from text, social
network, and images. By exploring news on a source level through
multiple coordinated views in Verifi2, users can interact with the
complex dimensions that characterize misinformation and contrast how
real and suspicious news outlets differ on these dimensions</p>
